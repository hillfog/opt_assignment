This repository contains implementations for large-scale optimization models using different frameworks. The repository is organized into two main directories:

- AIMMS Model: Contains the AIMMS model files.

- assignment_models: Includes both JuMP (Julia) and Pyomo (Python) code for the assignment models.

# For AIMMS Model:

- AIMMS software (version 24.6.1 or later)

# For JuMP Code:

Julia (version 1.11.2)

JuMP package (install via Julia package manager)

Appropriate solver (e.g., CPLEX or open-source alternatives)

# For Pyomo Code:

Python (3.11)

Pyomo package (install via pip)

Appropriate solver (e.g., CPLEX or open-source alternatives)
